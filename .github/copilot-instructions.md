# AI Agent Instructions for QR Code Component

This is a Frontend Mentor challenge project for building a responsive QR code component. Here's what you need to know to work effectively in this codebase:

## Project Structure
- `/design` - Contains mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px) design JPGs
- `/images` - Contains optimized assets including QR code and favicon
- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `style-guide.md` - Design tokens and specifications

## Design Requirements

### Layout
- Component should be responsive between 320px and large screens
- Two main breakpoints:
  - Mobile: 375px
  - Desktop: 1440px

### Colors
```css
--white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
--slate-300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
--slate-500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
--slate-900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
```

### Typography
- Font: 'Outfit' from Google Fonts
- Font weights: 400 (regular), 700 (bold)
- Paragraph size: 15px

## Development Guidelines
1. Structure HTML first before adding styles
2. Follow a mobile-first approach for responsive design
3. Use semantic HTML elements for accessibility
4. Follow WCAG requirements for accessibility
5. Maintain responsive behavior across all screen sizes (320px+)

## Deployment
Project can be deployed to:
- GitHub Pages

When making changes, ensure the final result matches the design files in `/design` as closely as possible while maintaining responsive behavior and accessibility standards.
